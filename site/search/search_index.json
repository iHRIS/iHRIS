In this case the ids and constraints won't even be stored for reference. When multiple matches are available, first it checks the id, then the first loaded constraint that matches will apply, it will not be combined. For example if one role assigns * read, Practitioner, abc, null, name and another does * read, Practitioner, null, meta.profile = 'x', telecom if Practitioner/abc is profile x, the user will only be able to see name. For any other Practitioners that are profile x they will only see telecom. Further if there is also * read, Practitioner, null, name.given = 'Test', birthDate then it will depend on the order the permissions were loaded when the profile is x and the given name is 'Test'. Basically getting too complex with overlapping permissions could cause odd circumstances, but this shoudl be unlikely. When there is a mix of wildcard and specific permissions/resources then the most specific will override when there are further constraints in the order below. Full permission will be allowed by anything that gives it. * read Practitioner * * Practitioner * read * * * * Based on the results returned from the previous step, when multiple match types have a restricted field list, it will be concatenated if multiples match. Saved in structure as: When the constraint is an ID it must start with '/' { \"permission\" : { \"resource\" : true | { \"*\" : \"field\" , \"id\" : { \"id1\" : \"field\" | true , \"id2\" : \"field\" | true }, \"constraint\" : { \"constraint1\" : \"field\" | true } } } }","title":"resolution"},{"location":"dev/roles_and_tasks/#examples","text":"Everything: user.addPermission( \" \", \" \" ) { \"*\" : { \"*\" : true } } Basic access to get any information: * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"StructureDefinition\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"ValueSet\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"CodeSystem\" ) { \"read\" : { \"StructureDefinition\" : true , \"ValueSet\" : true , \"CodeSystem\" : true }, } Complex example. * Resolution * If the id is 1234, user can see everthing. * If the profile is as below, those fields can be seen. * Otherwise the default fields can be seen. * addPermissions * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, null, \"name\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, null, \"gender\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, null, \"birthDate\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", \"1234\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, \"meta.profile = 'http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner'\", \"name\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, \"meta.profile = 'http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner'\", \"gender\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, \"meta.profile = 'http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner'\", \"birthDate\" ) * user.addPermission( \"read\", \"Practitioner\", null, \"meta.profile = 'http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner'\", \"qualification\" ) * user.addPermission( \"write\", \"Practitioner\", \"1234\" ) { \"read\" : { \"Practitioner\" : { // Can read all ihris-practitioner profiled Practitioners only for fields: name, gender, birthDate \"*\" : { \"name\" : true , \"gender\" : true , \"birthDate\" : true }, // Can read everything in Practitioner/1234 \"id\" : { \"1234\" : true }, \"constraint\" : { // Can read some fields when the profile is as given \"meta.profile = 'http://ihris.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ihris-practitioner'\" : { \"name\" : true , \"gender\" : true , \"birthDate\" : true , \"qualification\" : true } } } }, \"write\" : { \"Practitioner\" : { \"id\" : { \"1234\" : true } } // write does not guarantee read } } read Practitioner abc read Practitioner profile = xx fields [ telecom ] read Practitioner fields [ name ]","title":"examples"},{"location":"dev/roles_and_tasks/#constraints","text":"Constraints are FHIRPath expressions.
