Below are various ways you may use to customize iHRIS based on your needs Editing FSH files Creating custom iHRIS components iHRIS Apps Tasks And Roles Creating and editing Menu Creating custom nodeJS routes Creating custom nodeJS modules --- pending Editing fsh files When using this option for customization, developers need to edit the fsh files and upload them onto hapi server. Using FHIR Customizations can be used with FHIR Shorthand to define resources. https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-shorthand/ This will be better defined in the future, but for now, you can create the files in the fsh/ directory of the repository. You should use the same prefix for your files and various names that won't conflict with default iHRIS configurations. Create a Profile / Structure Definition You can profile existing FHIR resources and create extensions for to add fields. Any fields you want to show up on the default iHRIS page for the resource need the must support flag set. You can also set the label to display for the field as well as define validation constraints and valuesets to be used. Constraint keys must begin with \"ihris-\" to be processed. If the expression is the same, the key can be reused. Complete examples can be found in the fsh/ directory. The following is a simple example of a Practitioner profile. Profile: ExamplePractitioner Parent: Practitioner Id: example-practitioner Title: \"Example Practitioner\" Description: \"Example Practitioner for iHRIS\" * name 1..1 MS * name ^label = \"Name\" * name.family 1..1 MS * name.family ^ label = \"Surname\" * name.family ^constraint[0].key = \"ihris-name-check\" * name.family ^constraint[0].severity = #error * name.family ^constraint[0].expression = \"matches('^[A-Za-z ]*$')\" * name.family ^constraint[0].human = \"Name must be only text.\" * name.given 1..* MS * name.given ^label = \"Given Name\" * gender 1..1 MS * gender ^label = \"Gender\" * birthDate MS * birthDate ^label = \"Birth Date\" * birthDate obeys ihris-age-18 * birthDate ^minValueQuantity.system = \"http://unitsofmeasure.org/\" * birthDate ^minValueQuantity.code = #a * birthDate ^minValueQuantity.value = 100 * birthDate ^maxValueQuantity.system = \"http://unitsofmeasure.org/\" * birthDate ^maxValueQuantity.code = #a * birthDate ^maxValueQuantity.value = -18 * photo 0..1 MS * photo ^label = \"Photo\" Creating pages Pages define how a resource is displayed by default and how it is edited. You can control the sections displayed as well as the order of fields. Any fields that are defined in the profile as \"must support\" will appear in the first section if not included elsewhere. The page defines the search terms that can be used on a search page for the resource. The page defines any secondary resources that are linked to this resource and you can display those in a table on the page. You can include links to modify or create these secondary resources. https://github.com/iHRIS/iHRIS/blob/master/fsh/IhrisPage.fsh Creating single data entry pages Single data entry pages can be created using a FHIR Questionnaire.

For any other Practitioners that are profile x they will only see telecom. Further if there is also * read, Practitioner, null, name.given = 'Test', birthDate then it will depend on the order the permissions were loaded when the profile is x and the given name is 'Test'. Basically getting too complex with overlapping permissions could cause odd circumstances, but this shoudl be unlikely.

An example of a FHIR resource are Practitioner, Basic, Location, PractitionerRole etc. By the time this documentation was written, iHRIS had two non FHIR resources below: navigation: This control access to front end menus section: This control access to page sections i.e Practitioner section, Emergency Contact section etc permission: This is the permission to control access to a resource.

It is the primary registration page to add new employees, search/view records, and make changes to existing employee records. Note: before adding any new health workers into HRIS, first search to establish in that health worker does not already exist in the system. Add Person All records in iHRIS have to be populated before any reports can be generated. Health workers details are entered via \u201cAdd Person\u201d under \u201cPEOPLE\u201d module. To create a new employee record, click \u201cAdd People\u201d on the left side navigation bar. You will then add information to the fields of the record which will be explained in the next few sections of the manual. You can also add a new employee record from the Search People page. At the top of the table displaying employee records, click on the button in the right corner that says \"Add Health Worker Information\". Tips for Adding Information Here are some tips to help users through the process of adding information to records: The entry page is broken into multiple sections. You can scroll down to go to a different section, or click on a section from the right sidebar to skip directly to that section. Fields that are required are indicated with a red asterisk. Unless otherwise noted you should type the information directly into the space provided. Dropdown lists are available for some fields and are noted in the lockup lists. With most of the dropdown lists you can start typing the word that you wish to enter and you will be taken to it in the list, rather than having to scroll through the whole list. There may be date fields that require you to select the date on a calendar (see 3.5.3 for steps to select a date using the calendar tool). There may also be an option to include more than one entry for a single record component. For example, an employee may speak multiple languages or may have more than one dependent. If you see a dark gray bar at the top of a field with a plus sign at the right corner of the bar, this denotes a field that can have multiple entries. When selecting a location you will work through a series of dropdown menus. \u2022 Click on the Region to select it, or, click on the arrow beside the Region to see the corresponding Zones, then \u2022 Click on the Zone to select it, or click on the small grey arrow beside the Zone to see the corresponding Woredas, then \u2022 Select the Woreda (if available) Person Information Adding information to the person record The following information can be entered on a health worker\u2019s person record: Name \u2022 Prefix \u2022 First name (required) \u2022 First name alternative language \u2022 Father\u2019s name (required) \u2022 Father\u2019s name alternative language \u2022 Grandfather\u2019s last name (required) \u2022 Grandfather\u2019s last name alternative language \u2022 Mother\u2019s Full name (required) \u2022 Mother's name alternative language Demographic Information \u2022 Date of birth (required, select date from calendar) \u2022 Gender (required, select from dropdown) \u2022 Marital status (select from dropdown) \u2022 Nationality (Ethiopian is default, otherwise select from dropdown) \u2022 Ethnicity (select from dropdown) Identifiers (identification numbers) \u25cf Employee ID (required) \u25cf Pension number \u25cf TIN number \u25cf Civil service ID \u25cf License ID \u25cf File number (required) \u25cf Driving License \uf0a7 Driving License Type (select from dropdown) \uf0a7 Driving License ID Contacts \u25cf Mobile phone \u25cf Work Phone \u25cf Work email \u25cf Residence (required) Language Details Select the plus sign to add a language \u2022 Language (select from dropdown list) \u2022 Proficiency (select the plus sign to add proficiency, select from drop down): Select Excellent, Good, Poor, Very Good \u2022 Proficiency Type (select the plus sign to add proficiency, select from drop down): Select Listening, Reading, Speaking, Writing \u2022 Click the plus sign if you want to enter a second proficiency or additional proficiency types (if this is applicable). \u2022 Click the minus sign to remove a proficiency or proficiency type To enter a second language, click the plus sign next to Language. Repeat the above steps to Proficiency and Proficiency types for each additional language. Category For category, select from dropdown list \u25cf Select Academic (less than Grade 12 education level, Administrative, Health Professional Remarks If you have any general remarks about the employee to record, click on the plus sign then type any special remarks regarding the employee into the text box Photo Upload a photo of the employee by clicking in the blank field. From the pop-up window, select a file on your computer that you would like to upload as the picture of the employee. Note: There are additional employee record fields that can only be filled in through editing an existing position which will be explained under edit person record. Saving New Record When you are finished adding information or making changes, click the \"Save\" button at the top of the right sidebar. If you have not entered information in all the required fields indicated with a red asterisk, you will not be able to save the record. Review the form by scrolling to determine which required fields still need to be completed. Saving and editing later After a new record is saved, it is possible to edit or add additional information at any time. This is done by searching for the employee record as explained in the next section. After searching, select the desired record and click \u201cEdit\u201d in the top right corner. You can then add additional data to the record or modify the data already in the record. Search Records Existing health workers records can be accessed via \u201cSearch people\u201d under the module \u201cPEOPLE\u201d. From the left side navigation bar, Click \u201cSearch People\u201d to search for an employee. Using the search filters, you can search by \u25cf First name \u25cf Father\u2019s Name \u25cf Grand Father\u2019s Name \u25cf Mother\u2019s Name \u25cf Employee ID, or \u25cf PIN ID For example, type part or all of a name or ID number into the corresponding fields. Remember that you must hit the \"Enter\" or \"Return\" key on your keyboard to start the search. When you search, records matching your search will be pulled from the database. You can then select a search result to view the full record - this is done by clicking anywhere in the row of the record you want to view. 4.2.1 Tips for Searching When you enter a search term, it will only search the field in which you type the search term \u2013 not any other fields even if there is a match in another field. The example below shows searching using only first name \u201cIsmail\u201d Searching using Father\u2019s name \u201cIsmail\u201d gives different results Searching using Grand Father\u2019s Names \u201cIsmail\u201d also gives different results It is possible to search across two or more fields. This is done by conducting one search. Once the records have been filtered and you see the results of the first search, simply type in the next search term into the corresponding field. Once you hit \u201cEnter\u201d you will see the results with both filters applied. You can continue this process in each search field. Remember that to remove search filter, you should click on the X that is at the right side of the search field. You will need to do this for every field individually if you desire to remove other search terms/filters. 4.3 Edit Person There are two types of information that can be edited in a Person record: the basic information that is included in the initial \u201cAdd Person\u201d form when a new record is created, and additional information that is added once a new employee has started work. 4.3.1 Basic Employee Information To add or update information in an existing employee record: Following the process described previously to search for a record, locate the existing employee record that you wish to modify and click on it to open the record. At the top of the right sidebar click on the \"Edit\" button. Add information to the record. Here are a few tips: \u25cf The record page is broken into multiple sections. You can scroll down to access a different section, or you can click on a section from the right sidebar to skip directly to that section. \u25cf For the fields you wish to edit you can select item(s) from dropdown list(s) or type information directly into the record in any section and field. \u25cf Fields that are required are indicated with a red asterisk. Note: there are additional required fields when editing a record than when initially creating a record. \u25cf Remember that for some fields it will be possible to include more than one entry. 4.

The Integrated Human Resource Information System (iHRIS) is a free open-source software a web based computerized Human Resources management tool consisting of electronic databases for storing, analyzing and reporting data on Human Resources for Health (HRH) for evidence-based decisions on planning, managing, budgeting and policy shift in the health sector to improve access to services. iHRIS is designed using Low/ Middle Income Countries (LMIC) use cases, highly customizable, Standards compliant, Global technical support community, Global Good, and Adheres to Digital Development Principles. iHRIS was designed with Interoperability with other systems in mind basing on OpenHIE Architecture and FHIR Compliancy at its core. It was developed so that it can work with other components of Health Information System (HIS) including OpenMRS, facility registries, DHIS2, and it is part of mHero. iHRIS Architechture iHRIS Framework iHRIS is built on a flexible framework that allows ministries of health, professional councils, health training institutions, and health service delivery organizations to customize and adapt applications to meet a wide variety of needs for managing health workforce information. Developed by IntraHealth International inc. in collaboration with national stakeholders beginning in 2005, with support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), iHRIS is used in more than 20 countries to manage over a million health worker records at a potential cost savings of over $275 million when compared to commercial software. iHRIS is simple, easy-to-use with a beautiful, fast and responsive interface for mobile or desktop, with a clean, modern look and feel that is easily customized and translated to support specific use cases. It enables health-sector managers and leaders to capture and maintain high-quality information for health workforce planning, management, training tracking, deployment, regulation, and mapping as illustrated in Figure 1. With this information on health worker numbers, biodata, skills, qualifications, locations, and more; nations can address health workforce shortages and solve other challenges across the health sector and beyond. Implementation of iHRIS Using iHRIS, HR professionals are able create a centralized information base on all human resource management aspects such as standard titles, job classifications and job descriptions spreading over geographic locations, offices, and facilities. HR managers can solicit job applications for open positions, assign employees to fill positions and maintain a searchable database of all employees, their identifying information and their qualifications; track each employee's history with the organization, including their position and salary histories, attendance to duty, and record the reason for departure. iHRIS Use Framework HRIS\u2019s primary role is to manage workers employed through the FMOH at the ministry, regional, hospital, zonal, and woreda level.

Note: there are two tables of contacts - one within the mHero module, used for selecting contacts to send messages/flows to; and one within the People module, used for viewing records in the system. The table of contacts contains records for all health workers who have records in iHRIS, RapidPro, or mHero (or other connected registry). Each row contains information for one health worker. By default you will see 10 rows of results per page. In the bottom right corner of the table you will see some information about the results that are displayed. It tells you the number of rows being displayed per page followed by which results within the full set that are displayed (for example, \"1-10 of 68\" means the first 10 results within the set of 68 are being displayed). You can use the backward and forward pointing arrows to navigate through the pages of records. You can change the number of records displayed per page in the table by clicking the drop down menu next to \"Rows per page\" at the bottom right corner of the table. You can choose to display 5, 10, 20, or 50 records. The table will update once you have made your selection. Note: if there are more than 10,000 health worker records you will not have the option to display all on the same page due to the time it would take to pull up all of that data and browser capacity. You will have to select the option to see 10,000 records per page and view or select records in batches of 10,000. To search by name type all or part of their given name or surname in the space that looks like a tab and is labeled \"Fullname\". This is next to the table title (\"Employee List\"). You can search by a partial name and will see results that contain those letters. You must hit Enter or Return in order to run the search. If you wish to remove the name search filter, delete what you have typed and hit Enter or Return again. To search/filter by other fields (contact group/facility/job title/cadre) you click on the word in the field you wish to search. You can either type in a search word or scroll through the list to select a filter. To search, start typing what you want to search for and the list of options for that field will automatically filter to display matches; you can then select which match(es) you wish to use to filter the table. Alternatively you can scroll through the list to select the groups/facilities/job titles/cadres you wish to apply as filters. You can apply more than one filter including across more than one record field/column (i.e. two different groups or one facility plus one cadre). To remove or clear a filter you can either click on the X that is at the end of the field \"tab\" and that will clear all of the filters, or to clear a single filter at a time you can click on the search/filter term and touch the \"Delete\" key on your keyboard. Add a contact If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. Adding a contact in the iHRIS v5 shell where the mHero module is found will create a contact that can be sent a message/flow via mHero, but it will not add the contact to the main iHRIS instance. For this reason the data fields in the contact record are not the complete set that exist in iHRIS. To illustrate, you will be able to enter information such as name, contact details, job title, etc., but you will not be able to enter information such as from which institution the health worker received their degree, previous job positions, trainings they participated in, languages they speak, etc. To add a new contact to your mHero instance, click on \"Add Person\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar. Enter the information about the contact to the form. You can include identifiers and basic demographic information, contact information and also information about the health worker's position. You can either scroll down the page or click on a section in the right side navigation panel to jump to that section. Note the required fields which are indicated by red asterisks. The required fields vary by country. When you are finished adding information to the contact's record, click on the \"SAVE\" button in the top right corner of the page. If you try to save the record without putting text in all of the required fields you will not be able to save the record. In that case, you can scroll down the page to see the uncompleted required fields highlighted with a red frame. Add multiple contacts (bulk upload) If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. Modify contact information If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, modifying contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts modified in the iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. The only existing contacts that you will be able to modify are those that are stored in the iHRIS v5 shell. To modify contacts stored in the main iHRIS instance you must do so within the main iHRIS instance. To modify the record of an existing contact, click on \"Search People\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar. Locate the contact whose record you want to modify. You can do this by scrolling down through the table of contacts (including increasing the number of rows displayed per page) and by searching or applying filters. You can find guidance related to viewing and searching contacts here. When you have identified the contact whose record you want to modify, select it by clicking anywhere in the row in the table of contacts. The next page will display the fields included in each contact record and any associated information saved to that record. To edit any of the record fields click on the \"EDIT\" button at the top right corner of the page. You can then modify any of the information saved to the contact record or you can add information where information has not previously been added. Once you have finished making changes and additions click the \"SAVE\" button in the top right corner of the page. Note that there may be additional required fields than what was required when adding a new record. Ensure that you provide information for all required fields (which are indicated with a red asterisk). If you do not wish to save your changes you can click on the \"CANCEL\" button which is next to the \"SAVE\" button. Manually opt out a contact from receiving messages In addition to contacts opting out of messaging by sending a trigger word, it is also possible for system users to manually opt out individual contacts through the mHero interface. To manually opt out a contact from receiving messages, click on \"MHERO\" on the left side navigation panel, then click on \"Block Contact\". Search for the contact. To do so follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Select the contact(s) whom you would like to opt out from receiving messages by ticking the box to the left of their name in the table. Then click on \"BLOCK [n] SELECTED\", which is at the bottom right corner of the table, to opt the contact(s) out of future messaging. Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: View contact groups of a contact Many health workers will belong to multiple contact groups, however only one contact group will be visible in the Employee List table. To view all contact groups that a particular health worker belongs to, click on \"MHERO\" on the left side navigation panel, then click on \"Contact Groups\". Search for the contact. To do so follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Select the contact whose contact group(s) you would like to view by ticking the box to the left of their name in the table. Then click on \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" below the table in the left corner to see all contact groups that the contact is in (and which you can unsubscribe the contact from). Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: You will see the groups that the health worker belongs to in the \"Group Lists\" table. You can search and scroll through pages for health workers that belong to many groups. When you are done looking at the list of contact groups, click the X in the top right corner to not go through with unsubscribing the health worker from any of their contact groups. Make changes to a contact group (subscribe or unsubscribe contacts) On the \"Contact Groups\" page within the mHero module: Select the contacts that you would like to subscribe or unsubscribe from a contact group by ticking the boxes to the left of the names in the table. Note that you can only subscribe or unsubscribe at once so if you have contacts to subscribe and unsubscribe you will have to do those separately. The following are some tips for making your selection: 1.1. You can select all contacts on a page by clicking on the box farthest to the left in the table header row. Note that this will not select all contacts on all pages, only for the page you are viewing when you click to select all. 1.2. You may want to make selections on multiple pages so will want to navigate between pages of records or change the number of rows displayed per page. Follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". 1.3. You may want to search through all records and apply filters to make your selection. To do so follow the instructions in Follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Subscribe or unsubscribe the contacts from a contact group 2.1. Once you have completed selecting contacts, click on the button at the bottom of the page that corresponds to what you would like to do: the red UNSUBSCRIBE button is in the left corner and the blue SUBSCRIBE button is in the below the table in the middle. Note that the buttons may be only partially visible, as shown here: 2.2. In the pop-up window, below the word \"Group List\" you will see a list of the possible contact groups from which you can subscribe or unsubscribe contacts. 2.3. You can either scroll through this list to select the desired contact group or you can use the search function in the \"tab\" at the top of the list. If you wish to search by typing the group name you can type a partial group name and you will see all contact groups that match what you typed. After you have typed the full or partial group name, you need to hit the \"Enter\" or \"Return\" button to trigger the search. 2.4. Select the contact group(s) by clicking in the box to the left of the group name. 2.5. You can review the contacts that you are subscribing/unsubscribing in the table at the bottom of the pop-up window. If you see an error in this list you can click on the X in the top right corner of the pop-up window and you can revise your selection. 2.6. If you are finished selecting the contact group and reviewing the contacts you would like to subscribe/unsubscribe from that group, click on the green \"+ SAVE\" button (if subscribing) or the green \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" button (if unsubscribing). You should see a new pop-up with a confirmation of the change. Create a new contact group On the \"Contact Groups\" page within the mHero module: Click on the button in the bottom right corner (below the table) that says \"Add New Group\". Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: In the pop-up box click where you see the word \"Name\" and type the name of the new contact group. To create the new contact group click the button in the bottom right corner of the pop up box that says \"+ SAVE\". You should see a new pop-up box that confirms the creation of a new group, saying \"Success: Group Added Successfully\"; click on the button that says \"OK\" to finish. Delete a contact group","title":"Managing contacts mhero"},{"location":"user/mhero/","text":"mHero Assumptions What are some of the assumptions on mHero? iHRIS is installed or can be installed It is necessary to have iHRIS v5 or v4.3. The health worker contact information is complete and up-to-date. The essential health worker information for mHero includes: - name - phone number By default mHero also displays facility, job title, and cadre, but these fields can be customized. You may also want to include other fields such as organizational affiliation. There are several approaches to cleaning data depending on what needs to be corrected in the data. Scripts can be run on iHRIS and mHero to identify issues with records such as phone numbers with invalid formats (i.e. too many or too few digits, inappropriate characters, etc.), records that share the same phone number, records without phone numbers, and more. Some records may be easily updated, for example if the country code is included but should not be then that can be simply deleted. To confirm whether the name associated with a phone number is correct, a simple workflow can be sent through mHero. However, updating records where there is information missing is a manual process. For this reason, we recommend conducting regular data cleaning on an ongoing basis. A communication platform has been identified based on the channels that health workers frequently and easily use and the platform has been configured to send out messages. The communication platform should be one that is accessible by the largest number of health workers. For example, if most health workers in the capital area prefer WhatsApp but in the other regions of the country most health workers have only basic mobile phones, a SMS platform is a better fit than WhatsApp. mHero initially used RapidPro as the communication platform since it offers a simple interface for building flows and can be easily connected to SMS channels. In addition to the communication platform being identified, it is essential to have the platform configured to send out messages. This may include obtaining a short code for sending out SMS messages, setting up a WhatsApp Business Account, or phone numbers/accounts set up for other platforms and channels. This step can take a significant amount of time so it is recommended to explore the possibility of leveraging existing channels. \u25cf There is a plan for developing the content of messages and message flows Whether there is existing content or the content needs to be developed, there are key content creation considerations for different digital platforms. For example, with SMS it is necessary to limit the number of characters to 160, or the way people communicate via Facebook Messenger may be less formal. For more guidance see the Message Development Tip Sheet. \u25cf There is a plan for introducing mHero to health workers. It is recommended to introduce mHero to health workers prior to sending out the first message. You should inform them about: \u25a0 what mHero is \u25a0 how it will be used \u25a0 who the messages are coming from and who will review and respond \u25a0 how often they can expect messages \u25a0 whether they will be expected to respond or initiate communication (if they will be expected to initiate communication then you need to explain how they will do this) \u25a0 the costs (if any) to the health workers when they send messages \u25a0 any option for them to opt out of receiving messages (this may be required in some countries) As you can see, this is too much information to send via SMS when the first message goes out so it will need to be communicated in a different way - email, memo, during training or other gathering, etc. If you are unsure about some of those details when initially deploying mHero (for example, perhaps initially the health workers will not be expected or required to respond or initiate communication but that may change later), you don't need to include that information at the outset but should provide clear instructions when there are changes. There is a plan for analyzing the data and taking action based on results When asking health workers to send information related to their work activities, facility conditions, or other information, it is necessary to acknowledge their contributions and make use of the responses and data collected. This may look like generating reports that can demonstrate the need for additional funding, preparing a plan to provide supplies or other support to a facility facing unexpected needs, or countless other responses. When health workers know that the information they provide will serve some purpose, they will be more willing to respond to future requests. Architecture mHero 2.1 is basically made up of three parts: a database of health worker information, a communication platform, and the mHero Connector which links the two other components. This connection is made by using global interoperability standards for health information exchange, specifically Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Mobile Alert Communication Management (mACM). The configuration that has so far been tested and deployed links iHRIS, the IntraHealth-developed health workforce information systems software, and RapidPro, UNICEF's communication platform that enables communication via text messages, interactive voice response (IVR), as well as other messaging tools such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram. Information from health worker records is sourced from iHRIS, including: phone or other contact details, names, cadres, facility names, locations. This information is used to contact health workers, both broadly and targeted. Message flows or message campaigns created in RapidPro are pulled into the mHero module which also uses the communication channels set up there to send out messages. The architecture is flexible to connect different platforms and channels on both ends. Using FHIR standards makes it possible to connect any health information software that also uses FHIR, such as DHIS2, OpenMRS, and more. One possible use case with another software connected is pulling client phone numbers from OpenMRS to send reminders about upcoming appointments. While mHero has to-date only delivered text-based messages via SMS, there are many communications channels that can be utilized to connect with health workers via locally popular channels. Through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp it would be possible to send and receive multimedia content. mHero can also be connected with a traditional call center, where curated messages can enable trained staff to respond with speed and effectiveness. Finally, it is possible to incorporate natural language processing, permitting frontline health workers to ask questions using normal speech and the system can respond with the appropriate government-approved messages. Sending Messages with mHero What is MHERO? MHERO is acronym for the Global Open Facility Registry. MHERO is a shared repository for facility information. The information in the repository can vary and may include: Facilities Jurisdictions such as districts, regions, county, country , with the highest in the hierarchy being a country and the lowest being a facility. Services offered by facilities. This may include services such as malaria testing, HIV care, clinical information like vaccination Organizations that manage facilities Log In In order to access mHero, type the mHero url (web address) into the address bar of any browser A sample login screen is shown in the figure below. The email address plus the user password is required to login to the system. On clicking the Login button, the details entered are validated and one is allowed access if the details are correct. Otherwise, access is denied. Reset Password To reset your password, Click >Forgot Password > Submit A reset password link will be sent via the email address to reset your password. Click the link to Back to login and log in as normal Dashboard Once you successfully log in to the system, the dashboard appears: Logging Out To log out of the MHERO system: Browse to the upper right corner on any page, click Log Out. The Welcome page appears. You will have to re-enter your username and password to regain access to the system. View and search/filter contacts The table of contacts is used for many of the tasks you will do within mHero so it merits an explanation before explaining how to use the platform. Note: there are two tables of contacts - one within the mHero module, used for selecting contacts to send messages/flows to; and one within the People module, used for viewing records in the system. The table of contacts contains records for all health workers who have records in iHRIS, RapidPro, or mHero (or other connected registry). Each row contains information for one health worker.

It tells you the number of rows being displayed per page followed by which results within the full set that are displayed (for example, \"1-10 of 68\" means the first 10 results within the set of 68 are being displayed). You can use the backward and forward pointing arrows to navigate through the pages of records. You can change the number of records displayed per page in the table by clicking the drop down menu next to \"Rows per page\" at the bottom right corner of the table. You can choose to display 5, 10, 20, or 50 records. The table will update once you have made your selection. Note: if there are more than 10,000 health worker records you will not have the option to display all on the same page due to the time it would take to pull up all of that data and browser capacity. You will have to select the option to see 10,000 records per page and view or select records in batches of 10,000. To search by name type all or part of their given name or surname in the space that looks like a tab and is labeled \"Fullname\". This is next to the table title (\"Employee List\"). You can search by a partial name and will see results that contain those letters. You must hit Enter or Return in order to run the search. If you wish to remove the name search filter, delete what you have typed and hit Enter or Return again.

The health worker contact information is complete and up-to-date. The essential health worker information for mHero includes: - name - phone number By default mHero also displays facility, job title, and cadre, but these fields can be customized. You may also want to include other fields such as organizational affiliation. There are several approaches to cleaning data depending on what needs to be corrected in the data. Scripts can be run on iHRIS and mHero to identify issues with records such as phone numbers with invalid formats (i.e. too many or too few digits, inappropriate characters, etc.), records that share the same phone number, records without phone numbers, and more. Some records may be easily updated, for example if the country code is included but should not be then that can be simply deleted. To confirm whether the name associated with a phone number is correct, a simple workflow can be sent through mHero. However, updating records where there is information missing is a manual process. For this reason, we recommend conducting regular data cleaning on an ongoing basis. A communication platform has been identified based on the channels that health workers frequently and easily use and the platform has been configured to send out messages. The communication platform should be one that is accessible by the largest number of health workers. For example, if most health workers in the capital area prefer WhatsApp but in the other regions of the country most health workers have only basic mobile phones, a SMS platform is a better fit than WhatsApp. mHero initially used RapidPro as the communication platform since it offers a simple interface for building flows and can be easily connected to SMS channels. In addition to the communication platform being identified, it is essential to have the platform configured to send out messages. This may include obtaining a short code for sending out SMS messages, setting up a WhatsApp Business Account, or phone numbers/accounts set up for other platforms and channels. This step can take a significant amount of time so it is recommended to explore the possibility of leveraging existing channels. \u25cf There is a plan for developing the content of messages and message flows Whether there is existing content or the content needs to be developed, there are key content creation considerations for different digital platforms. For example, with SMS it is necessary to limit the number of characters to 160, or the way people communicate via Facebook Messenger may be less formal. For more guidance see the Message Development Tip Sheet. \u25cf There is a plan for introducing mHero to health workers. It is recommended to introduce mHero to health workers prior to sending out the first message. You should inform them about: \u25a0 what mHero is \u25a0 how it will be used \u25a0 who the messages are coming from and who will review and respond \u25a0 how often they can expect messages \u25a0 whether they will be expected to respond or initiate communication (if they will be expected to initiate communication then you need to explain how they will do this) \u25a0 the costs (if any) to the health workers when they send messages \u25a0 any option for them to opt out of receiving messages (this may be required in some countries) As you can see, this is too much information to send via SMS when the first message goes out so it will need to be communicated in a different way - email, memo, during training or other gathering, etc. If you are unsure about some of those details when initially deploying mHero (for example, perhaps initially the health workers will not be expected or required to respond or initiate communication but that may change later), you don't need to include that information at the outset but should provide clear instructions when there are changes. There is a plan for analyzing the data and taking action based on results When asking health workers to send information related to their work activities, facility conditions, or other information, it is necessary to acknowledge their contributions and make use of the responses and data collected. This may look like generating reports that can demonstrate the need for additional funding, preparing a plan to provide supplies or other support to a facility facing unexpected needs, or countless other responses. When health workers know that the information they provide will serve some purpose, they will be more willing to respond to future requests. Architecture mHero 2.1 is basically made up of three parts: a database of health worker information, a communication platform, and the mHero Connector which links the two other components. This connection is made by using global interoperability standards for health information exchange, specifically Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Mobile Alert Communication Management (mACM). The configuration that has so far been tested and deployed links iHRIS, the IntraHealth-developed health workforce information systems software, and RapidPro, UNICEF's communication platform that enables communication via text messages, interactive voice response (IVR), as well as other messaging tools such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram. Information from health worker records is sourced from iHRIS, including: phone or other contact details, names, cadres, facility names, locations. This information is used to contact health workers, both broadly and targeted. Message flows or message campaigns created in RapidPro are pulled into the mHero module which also uses the communication channels set up there to send out messages. The architecture is flexible to connect different platforms and channels on both ends. Using FHIR standards makes it possible to connect any health information software that also uses FHIR, such as DHIS2, OpenMRS, and more. One possible use case with another software connected is pulling client phone numbers from OpenMRS to send reminders about upcoming appointments. While mHero has to-date only delivered text-based messages via SMS, there are many communications channels that can be utilized to connect with health workers via locally popular channels. Through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp it would be possible to send and receive multimedia content. mHero can also be connected with a traditional call center, where curated messages can enable trained staff to respond with speed and effectiveness. Finally, it is possible to incorporate natural language processing, permitting frontline health workers to ask questions using normal speech and the system can respond with the appropriate government-approved messages.","title":"Assumptions"},{"location":"user/mhero/#sending-messages-with-mhero","text":"What is MHERO?

Note: there are two tables of contacts - one within the mHero module, used for selecting contacts to send messages/flows to; and one within the People module, used for viewing records in the system. The table of contacts contains records for all health workers who have records in iHRIS, RapidPro, or mHero (or other connected registry). Each row contains information for one health worker. By default you will see 10 rows of results per page. In the bottom right corner of the table you will see some information about the results that are displayed. It tells you the number of rows being displayed per page followed by which results within the full set that are displayed (for example, \"1-10 of 68\" means the first 10 results within the set of 68 are being displayed). You can use the backward and forward pointing arrows to navigate through the pages of records. You can change the number of records displayed per page in the table by clicking the drop down menu next to \"Rows per page\" at the bottom right corner of the table. You can choose to display 5, 10, 20, or 50 records. The table will update once you have made your selection. Note: if there are more than 10,000 health worker records you will not have the option to display all on the same page due to the time it would take to pull up all of that data and browser capacity. You will have to select the option to see 10,000 records per page and view or select records in batches of 10,000. To search by name type all or part of their given name or surname in the space that looks like a tab and is labeled \"Fullname\". This is next to the table title (\"Employee List\"). You can search by a partial name and will see results that contain those letters. You must hit Enter or Return in order to run the search. If you wish to remove the name search filter, delete what you have typed and hit Enter or Return again. To search/filter by other fields (contact group/facility/job title/cadre) you click on the word in the field you wish to search. You can either type in a search word or scroll through the list to select a filter. To search, start typing what you want to search for and the list of options for that field will automatically filter to display matches; you can then select which match(es) you wish to use to filter the table. Alternatively you can scroll through the list to select the groups/facilities/job titles/cadres you wish to apply as filters. You can apply more than one filter including across more than one record field/column (i.e. two different groups or one facility plus one cadre). To remove or clear a filter you can either click on the X that is at the end of the field \"tab\" and that will clear all of the filters, or to clear a single filter at a time you can click on the search/filter term and touch the \"Delete\" key on your keyboard. Add a contact If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. Adding a contact in the iHRIS v5 shell where the mHero module is found will create a contact that can be sent a message/flow via mHero, but it will not add the contact to the main iHRIS instance. For this reason the data fields in the contact record are not the complete set that exist in iHRIS. To illustrate, you will be able to enter information such as name, contact details, job title, etc., but you will not be able to enter information such as from which institution the health worker received their degree, previous job positions, trainings they participated in, languages they speak, etc. To add a new contact to your mHero instance, click on \"Add Person\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar. Enter the information about the contact to the form. You can include identifiers and basic demographic information, contact information and also information about the health worker's position. You can either scroll down the page or click on a section in the right side navigation panel to jump to that section. Note the required fields which are indicated by red asterisks. The required fields vary by country. When you are finished adding information to the contact's record, click on the \"SAVE\" button in the top right corner of the page. If you try to save the record without putting text in all of the required fields you will not be able to save the record. In that case, you can scroll down the page to see the uncompleted required fields highlighted with a red frame. Add multiple contacts (bulk upload) If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, adding contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts created in iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. Modify contact information If the iHRIS instance has not been updated to v5, modifying contact records should be done in the iHRIS instance that is already in use, not in the iHRIS v5 shell. Contacts modified in the iHRIS v5 shell will not be synced to the primary iHRIS instance. The only existing contacts that you will be able to modify are those that are stored in the iHRIS v5 shell. To modify contacts stored in the main iHRIS instance you must do so within the main iHRIS instance. To modify the record of an existing contact, click on \"Search People\" either in the dashboard on the home page or in the left side navigation bar. Locate the contact whose record you want to modify. You can do this by scrolling down through the table of contacts (including increasing the number of rows displayed per page) and by searching or applying filters. You can find guidance related to viewing and searching contacts here. When you have identified the contact whose record you want to modify, select it by clicking anywhere in the row in the table of contacts. The next page will display the fields included in each contact record and any associated information saved to that record. To edit any of the record fields click on the \"EDIT\" button at the top right corner of the page. You can then modify any of the information saved to the contact record or you can add information where information has not previously been added. Once you have finished making changes and additions click the \"SAVE\" button in the top right corner of the page. Note that there may be additional required fields than what was required when adding a new record. Ensure that you provide information for all required fields (which are indicated with a red asterisk). If you do not wish to save your changes you can click on the \"CANCEL\" button which is next to the \"SAVE\" button. Manually opt out a contact from receiving messages In addition to contacts opting out of messaging by sending a trigger word, it is also possible for system users to manually opt out individual contacts through the mHero interface. To manually opt out a contact from receiving messages, click on \"MHERO\" on the left side navigation panel, then click on \"Block Contact\". Search for the contact. To do so follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Select the contact(s) whom you would like to opt out from receiving messages by ticking the box to the left of their name in the table. Then click on \"BLOCK [n] SELECTED\", which is at the bottom right corner of the table, to opt the contact(s) out of future messaging. Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: View contact groups of a contact Many health workers will belong to multiple contact groups, however only one contact group will be visible in the Employee List table. To view all contact groups that a particular health worker belongs to, click on \"MHERO\" on the left side navigation panel, then click on \"Contact Groups\". Search for the contact. To do so follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Select the contact whose contact group(s) you would like to view by ticking the box to the left of their name in the table. Then click on \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" below the table in the left corner to see all contact groups that the contact is in (and which you can unsubscribe the contact from). Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: You will see the groups that the health worker belongs to in the \"Group Lists\" table. You can search and scroll through pages for health workers that belong to many groups. When you are done looking at the list of contact groups, click the X in the top right corner to not go through with unsubscribing the health worker from any of their contact groups. Make changes to a contact group (subscribe or unsubscribe contacts) On the \"Contact Groups\" page within the mHero module: Select the contacts that you would like to subscribe or unsubscribe from a contact group by ticking the boxes to the left of the names in the table. Note that you can only subscribe or unsubscribe at once so if you have contacts to subscribe and unsubscribe you will have to do those separately. The following are some tips for making your selection: 1.1. You can select all contacts on a page by clicking on the box farthest to the left in the table header row. Note that this will not select all contacts on all pages, only for the page you are viewing when you click to select all. 1.2. You may want to make selections on multiple pages so will want to navigate between pages of records or change the number of rows displayed per page. Follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". 1.3. You may want to search through all records and apply filters to make your selection. To do so follow the instructions in Follow the instructions in the above section \"View and search/filter contacts\". Subscribe or unsubscribe the contacts from a contact group 2.1. Once you have completed selecting contacts, click on the button at the bottom of the page that corresponds to what you would like to do: the red UNSUBSCRIBE button is in the left corner and the blue SUBSCRIBE button is in the below the table in the middle. Note that the buttons may be only partially visible, as shown here: 2.2. In the pop-up window, below the word \"Group List\" you will see a list of the possible contact groups from which you can subscribe or unsubscribe contacts. 2.3. You can either scroll through this list to select the desired contact group or you can use the search function in the \"tab\" at the top of the list. If you wish to search by typing the group name you can type a partial group name and you will see all contact groups that match what you typed. After you have typed the full or partial group name, you need to hit the \"Enter\" or \"Return\" button to trigger the search. 2.4. Select the contact group(s) by clicking in the box to the left of the group name. 2.5. You can review the contacts that you are subscribing/unsubscribing in the table at the bottom of the pop-up window. If you see an error in this list you can click on the X in the top right corner of the pop-up window and you can revise your selection. 2.6. If you are finished selecting the contact group and reviewing the contacts you would like to subscribe/unsubscribe from that group, click on the green \"+ SAVE\" button (if subscribing) or the green \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" button (if unsubscribing). You should see a new pop-up with a confirmation of the change. Create a new contact group On the \"Contact Groups\" page within the mHero module: Click on the button in the bottom right corner (below the table) that says \"Add New Group\". Note that the button may be only partially visible, as shown here: In the pop-up box click where you see the word \"Name\" and type the name of the new contact group. To create the new contact group click the button in the bottom right corner of the pop up box that says \"+ SAVE\". You should see a new pop-up box that confirms the creation of a new group, saying \"Success: Group Added Successfully\"; click on the button that says \"OK\" to finish.","title":"View and search/filter contacts"},{"location":"user/mhero/#accessing-reports-in-mhero","text":"What is MHERO?

The configuration that has so far been tested and deployed links iHRIS, the IntraHealth-developed health workforce information systems software, and RapidPro, UNICEF's communication platform that enables communication via text messages, interactive voice response (IVR), as well as other messaging tools such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram. Information from health worker records is sourced from iHRIS, including: phone or other contact details, names, cadres, facility names, locations. This information is used to contact health workers, both broadly and targeted. Message flows or message campaigns created in RapidPro are pulled into the mHero module which also uses the communication channels set up there to send out messages. The architecture is flexible to connect different platforms and channels on both ends. Using FHIR standards makes it possible to connect any health information software that also uses FHIR, such as DHIS2, OpenMRS, and more. One possible use case with another software connected is pulling client phone numbers from OpenMRS to send reminders about upcoming appointments. While mHero has to-date only delivered text-based messages via SMS, there are many communications channels that can be utilized to connect with health workers via locally popular channels. Through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp it would be possible to send and receive multimedia content. mHero can also be connected with a traditional call center, where curated messages can enable trained staff to respond with speed and effectiveness. Finally, it is possible to incorporate natural language processing, permitting frontline health workers to ask questions using normal speech and the system can respond with the appropriate government-approved messages.","title":"Assumptions"},{"location":"user/people/","text":"People Health workers details are managed in the module \u201cPEOPLE\u201d; which includes the option to add health workers and search health worker records in the system.
