At the bottom of a report, you are able to see the number of records displayed on the page and the total records (those that match search/filter criteria or all records if no search/filter criteria have been applied).

In the screenshot below of a report, you can see that 10 records are being displayed. The total records in the report are 68. In this example no search or filter criteria were applied but when you have searched or applied a filter, the total records will be the count of all records that match the search/filter criteria.

Clicking on the < or > in the bottom right-hand corner of a report, you are able to navigate to next page of records.

You can change the number of records that are displayed on each page by clicking the downward arrow to the right of the number of rows per page.

Clicking on the arrow will open a list of the options for the number of rows (5, 10, 20, 50) per page to display.

8.6.2 Sorting Records

Hovering over any column name in the report displays an arrow (see screenshot below) next to or below the column title . By clicking on it, you are able to display the table contents in ascending order based on this column; clicking on it again you get the table contents descending order based on this column.; and clicking on it a third time will return the table contents to the default order.
