# Audit Logs

Audit logs, also known as audit trails or audit records, are chronological records that document and provide a detailed account of activities, events, and actions taken within a system, application, or network. 

These logs serve as a security and accountability measure, helping organizations track and review changes, user interactions, and system activities. 

The logs are displayed as shown below. Users can filter the records by ** the date of action, the specific action, and the userID**.
