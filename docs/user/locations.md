# Locations

This module enables a user to add and manage locations, facilities, and department/case teams in the database. It is the primary place to add new, search, and make changes to existing locations, facilities, and department/case teams.

## Add Location, Facility, or Department/Case Team
On this page you can create a location, facility, or department/case team by adding information to the fields.

1. To create a new location, facility, or department/case team click on "Locations..." on the left side navigation bar and then click on either "Location" or "Facility" or "Departments/Case Te..." on the left side navigation bar.

a. To add a location, at the top of the table displaying locations, click on the light blue "Add Jurisdictions (Country/Region/Zone/Woreda)" button.

b. To add a facility, at the top of the table displaying facilities, click on the light blue button in the top right corner that says "Add Facility".

2. Enter the information about the new location, facility, or department/case team to its record. Here are a few tips:

● Fields in the blank form that are required are indicated with a red asterisk.

● Dropdown lists are available for some fields and are noted in the list below.

● With dropdown lists you can start typing the word that you wish to enter and you will be taken to it in the list, rather than scrolling through the whole list.

When you are done making changes, click the "Save" button at the top of the right sidebar.

## Search Location or Facility or Department/Case Team

On these pages you can search for a location, facility or department/case team using keywords and filters.

1. From the left side navigation bar, click “Location" or "Facility” or "Department/CaseTeam" to search for a location or facility or department/case team.
2. There are several options for searching.
    a. With locations you can search by name, location type, and jurisdiction. With facilities you can search by name, type, and physical type. With departments/case           teams, you can search by name, type, or CaseTeam Department.
    b. If searching by name, jurisdiction, or case team department you should type part or all of the location/facility name; you must hit the "Enter" or "Return" key          on your keyboard to start the search.
              • To search by location type, facility type or physical type, or Department/Case Team Type you should scroll through the drop down lists and make a                         selection.
              • You can search by multiple fields or multiple entries within the same field (i.e. by one location type and one jurisdiction, or by two different                          location types).
              • Records matching your search will be pulled from the database. See the tips for viewing the results in the table.
3. You can then select a search result to view the full record - this is done by clicking anywhere in the row of the record you want to view.
