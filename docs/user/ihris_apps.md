This module enables a user to set up and manage positions in the database. It is the primary place to add new positions, search positions in the system, and make changes to existing positions.

## Add Positions

On this page you can create a new Position record by adding information to the associated fields. To create a new position:

1. Click on "Add Position" on the left side navigation bar.

You can also add a new position from the Search Position page. At the top of the table displaying positions, click on the button in the right corner that says "Add Position".

2. Add information to the new Position.

Here are a few tips:

* Fields that are required are indicated with a red asterisk.
* Unless noted you should type the information directly into the space provided for each field.
* Dropdown lists are available for some fields and are noted in the list below.
* With dropdown lists you can start typing the word that you wish to enter and you will be taken to it in the list, rather than scrolling through the whole list.
* For other fields you will type the information directly into the space provided, or you will select the date on a calendar. See the steps for using the calendar selector in the Navigation section.

Note: you can create a position without associating it with a person.
