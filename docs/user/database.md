# Database

Health workers details are managed via module “PEOPLE”; which includes the option to add health workers and search health worker records in the system. It is the primary registration page to add new employees, search/view records, and make changes to existing employee records.

Note: before adding any new health workers into HRIS, first search to establish in that health worker does not already exist in the system.

## Add Person

All records in iHRIS have to be populated before any reports can be generated. Health workers details are entered via “Add Person” under “PEOPLE” module.

To create a new employee record, click “Add People” on the left side navigation bar. You will then add information to the fields of the record which will be explained in the next few sections of the manual.
You can also add a new employee record from the Search People page. At the top of the table displaying employee records, click on the button in the right corner that says "Add Health Worker Information".

### Tips for Adding Information

Here are some tips to help users through the process of adding information to records:

1. The entry page is broken into multiple sections. You can scroll down to go to a different section, or click on a section from the right sidebar to skip directly to that section.

2. Fields that are required are indicated with a red asterisk.
3. Unless otherwise noted you should type the information directly into the space provided.
4. Dropdown lists are available for some fields and are noted in the lockup lists.
5. With most of the dropdown lists you can start typing the word that you wish to enter and you will be taken to it in the list, rather than having to scroll through the whole list.
6. There may be date fields that require you to select the date on a calendar (see 3.5.3 for steps to select a date using the calendar tool).
7. There may also be an option to include more than one entry for a single record component. For example, an employee may speak multiple languages or may have more than one dependent. If you see a dark gray bar at the top of a field with a plus sign at the right corner of the bar, this denotes a field that can have multiple entries.

8. When selecting a location you will work through a series of dropdown menus:
      • Click on the Region to select it, or, click on the arrow beside the Region to see the corresponding Zones, then
      • Click on the Zone to select it, or click on the small grey arrow beside the Zone to see the corresponding _Woredas, then
      • Select the _Woreda (if available)

Review the form by scrolling to determine which required fields still need to be completed.

3. Saving and editing later

After searching, select the desired record and click “Edit” in the top right corner. You can then add additional data to the record or modify the data already in the record.

## Search Records

Existing health workers records can be accessed via “Search people” under the module “PEOPLE”. From the left side navigation bar, Click “Search People” to search for an employee.

Using the search filters, you can search by
● First name
● Father’s Name
● Grand Father’s Name
● Mother’s Name
● Employee ID, or
● PIN ID

For example, type part or all of a name or ID number into the corresponding fields. Remember that you must hit the "Enter" or "Return" key on your keyboard to start the search.

When you search, records matching your search will be pulled from the database. You can then select a search result to view the full record - this is done by clicking anywhere in the row of the record you want to view.

4.2.1 Tips for Searching

1. When you enter a search term, it will only search the field in which you type the search term – not any other fields even if there is a match in another field. The example below shows searching using only first name “Ismail”

Searching using Father’s name “Ismail” gives different results

Searching using Grand Father’s Names “Ismail” also gives different results

2. It is possible to search across two or more fields. This is done by conducting one search. Once the records have been filtered and you see the results of the first search, simply type in the next search term into the corresponding field. Once you hit “Enter” you will see the results with both filters applied. You can continue this process in each search field.

3. Remember that to remove search filter, you should click on the X that is at the right side of the search field. You will need to do this for every field individually if you desire to remove other search terms/filters.
