### Header
There are two configuration options that can be set for the header

#### Logo
Place a link to an image file (prefereably png) to have a logo render in the header of your application.

#### Site
The text set for the site configuration will be rendered in the header of your application.

### Backend
This is a link to where the [server](https://github.com/iHRIS/iHRIS/tree/master/server) component is running. Depending on your configuration, it may or may not need to include the port the application is running on.

### Kibana
Kibana is used to render dashboards on the home page. Update the config file to include a link to your kibana installation. You will also need to add this link to the [server](https://github.com/iHRIS/iHRIS/tree/master/server)

### mHero
mHero is a two-way, mobile phone-based communication system that uses basic text messaging, or SMS, to connect ministries of health and health workers. To enable mHero, you need to setup an [emNutt server](https://github.com/intrahealth/emNutt). You also need to update your configuration file and set mHero to true.
